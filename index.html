        <p>To direct data packages from a user’s browser to one of the collection servers in the cluster
             load balancing architecture can be implemented as shown in figure below. 
             The load balancer can be implemented either using AWS ELB/ Azure Load Balancer services or 
             setting up an on-premise load balancer using Nginx web server. </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Load balancer: </strong>
            The user will send an Http request using the single point URL provided by Celebrus such as   https://collection.celebrus.com. 
            The load balancer, placed in front of the cluster of servers, will receive all incoming traffic from the user’s browser. 
            The load balancer will use a suitable routing algorithm such as round robin, weighted round robin, least connection, IP hash, etc. to determine which server should receive the data package.
            <br> 
            <strong>Load balancer algorithm: </strong>
            Load balancer routing algorithm can be determined based on factors such as 
            available servers in the cluster, load on each available server, and the 
            amount of traffic. AWS ELB and Azure Load balancer commonly use round robin or least connection routing algorithm. 
            The ‘on premise’ load balancer such as Nginx can allow for more flexibility and can be configured the following way:
            
            <pre><code>
    http {
        upstream backend {
            least_conn; 
            server exchange1.example.com;
            server exchange2.example.com;

        server {
                listen              443 ssl;
                ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/company.com.crt;
                ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/company.com.key;
                ssl_protocols       TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
                server_name collection.celebrus.com;

            location / {
            proxy_pass https://collection.celebrus.com;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Connection “”;
            
            }
        }
    }
            </code></pre>
            <strong>Monitoring system: </strong>
            The monitoring system is configured to monitor the health and performance of the system. 
            It can help identify issues that could impact the user experience. 
            It keeps a track of metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, downtime, etc. 
            Implementing a monitoring system can be done via AWS/ Azure monitor services or other open source software such as Prometheus.

        <h5>Answer 2- Data Protection</h5>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) 
            significantly impact data capture. These regulations mandate that organizations must process 
            personal data lawfully and fairly through transparency, consent from users, 
            provision of access to delete their personal data. 
            To comply with GDPR and CCPA, organizations must establish and maintain robust procedures for 
            collecting and processing personal data as it can significantly impact their core operations.
            <br>
            Key differences between the two regulations and how they impact data capture:
