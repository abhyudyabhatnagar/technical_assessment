        <h5>Answer 1 - Collection</h5>
        <p>To direct data packages from a user’s browser to one of the collection servers in cluster, a
             load balancing architecture can be implemented as shown in figure below. 
             Described architecture can be implemented either using AWS ELB/ Azure Load Balancer or 
             set up using an on-premise server such as Nginx. </p>

            <strong>Load balancer: </strong>
            User`s browser sends a http request using a single endpoint URL, https://collection.celebrus.com, provided by Celebrus. 
            The load balancer, placed in front of server cluster, receives all incoming traffic. 
            It use a suitable routing algorithm such as round robin, weighted round robin, least connection, IP hash, etc. 
            to determine which server should receive the incoming data package.
            <br> 
            <strong>Load balancer algorithm: </strong>
            Routing algorithm can be determined based on factors such as available servers in the cluster, 
            load on each available server, and amount of traffic. AWS ELB and Azure Load balancer commonly use round robin or least connection routing algorithm whereas an ‘on-premise’ 
            Nginx load balancer can allow for more flexibility. Nginx can be configured the following way:
            
            <pre><code>
    http {
        upstream backend {
            least_conn; 
            server exchange1.example.com;
            server exchange2.example.com;

        server {
                listen              443 ssl;
                ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/company.com.crt;
                ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/company.com.key;
                ssl_protocols       TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
                server_name collection.celebrus.com;

            location / {
            proxy_pass https://collection.celebrus.com;
            proxy_http_version 1.1;
            proxy_set_header Connection “”;
            
            }
        }
    }
            </code></pre>
            <strong>Monitoring system: </strong>
            It is configured to monitor health and performance of the system. 
            It can help identify issues that could impact user experience. 
            It keeps a track of metrics such as CPU utilization, network traffic, downtime, etc. 
            Implementing a monitoring system can be done via AWS/ Azure monitor services or other 
            open source software such as Prometheus.

        <h5>Answer 2- Data Protection</h5>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) 
            significantly impact data capture practices. These regulations impose strict obligations on organizations to 
            process personal data lawfully and equitably, necessitating transparency, user consent, and the right to delete personal data.
            <br>
            Key differences between the two regulations and how they impact data capture:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>

                    <td>Transparency</td>
                    <td colspan="2">Both regulations require transparency related to how personal data is collected, 
                        used and shared.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td colspan="2">Both regulations require individual`s right to access and delete their personal data. 
                        GDPR provides additional rights that allow individuals to rectify incorrect data and 
                        right to data portability.</td>

                    <td colspan="2">
                        Non-compliance with these regulations can result in significant penalties, 
                        legal action, and damage to reputation.
